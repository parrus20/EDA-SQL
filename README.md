Analyze International Debt Statistics
In this project, we explore the dynamics of international debt by analyzing data collected from The World Bank. Countries often incur debt not just to meet immediate needs but also to manage economic growth and infrastructure spending, which are vital for the comfort and well-being of their citizens. This analysis will provide insights into the debt situations of various developing countries, focusing on distinct categories of debt.

Objectives
Using the provided dataset, our analysis aims to answer the following questions:

What is the number of distinct countries present in the database?
Which country has the highest amount of debt?
Which country has the lowest amount of repayments?
What is the total debt across all countries?
Who are the top 5 countries with the most debt?
What is the total and average debt for South Africa?
How many debt indicators are recorded in the dataset?
Which debt indicator has the highest value?
What is the average debt per country?
Which countries have more than a certain amount of debt (e.g., 1 billion USD)?
